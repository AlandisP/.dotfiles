	Throughout this lab, I had to create various files and use old commands in order to get be successful. I first had to use common knowledge and follow the directions on then assignment and go on from there. Since there were no commands given, Ihad to use my notebook to reference what I had to use in order to complete certain task. I had already had a github account so, I already knew how to create a new repository and set the settings in order to complete that step. When I finished creating the repository it was then time to start back using linux to start getting access to github.
	The first thing I had to do was set up git on the command line by running the 2 commands provided in the homework. I then had to use the cd command in order to go to the .ssh directory. I the created the required file and used the vim command edit the config file. I then created the github directory then ran the command. I then went through the exact process we went through in class and made sure to get the public file and not the private file. I then added the ssh key the github
	Towards one of the final parts of the assignments I had to create files for github. When working on the README.md file, I had got confused on what direcory to be in and so I ended up putting it in me home directory, I then used the mv command in order to move it to my .dotfiles directory. After initializing the git hub, I noted that my README.md file so then I had to do some moving around and reinitialize the git in order to be successful. I had to use the mv and all the git commands again in order to be able to get everything into github.
